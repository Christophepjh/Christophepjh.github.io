            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <hr>
            <h1>The Future of Meat</h1>
            <p>In 2013 the first lab grown meat burher was eaten on live TV. Over $300,000 was spent with reseach spanning 2 years, the result being a single burger which food critics described as indistinguishable to real meat. Despite the slow and expensive start, the lab grown meat sector is booming. Today, over 60 firms are developing some form of lab grown meat.</p>
            <p>In this project, I will explore the lab grown meat market through three sections:</p>
            <p>	1. Motivation behind the development of lab grown meat</p>
            <p> 2. Innovation and evolution of the meat industry</p>
            <p> 3. Adaptation that will be required to move towards lab grown meat</p>

        <h3>Motivation</h3>
        <hr>
        <h1>What problems can lab grown meat solve?</h1>
        <p>In this section I will look at the trends in global meat production and consumption</p>
        

        <div class="container">
            <!-- Chart 1 -->
            <p>This scatter bubble chart shows the relationship between a nations wealth and meat consumption. A clear positive trend is observed between wealth and meat consumption. We also observe that many of the worlds most populous nations, notably India, have low meat consumption. As these nations develop, demand for meat will rise.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <p>These maps show the rise in the worlds most popular protein producing animals. The prominence of meat production in chine is evident. 83% of all agricultural land use in dedicated to meat and dairy production, taking up to 30% of the earths land surface and producing 18% of our greenhouse gas emitions.</p>

        <div class="container">
            <p>Food security is a real issue for countries that do not have enough land to feed its population. This API shows the difference between UK meat imports and exports. On average, the UK imports three times more meat than it exports. Lab grown meat production would be far less dependent on land area.</p>

        <h1>Is lab grown meat a feasible alternative?</h1> 
        <p>In this section I look at the past innovations in the meat market and devlopments in the lab grown meat sector.</p>
    
    <!-- Chart 4 -->
        <div class="container">
            <p>We have turned the broiler chicken into a meat producing machine. Data scraped from teh US National Chicken Council shows the evolution of the broiler chicken from 1925 to 2021. Chickens today produce more meat, develop faster, die less and eat less food than their ancestors. However, this development is slowing. Approximately 69 billion chickens are killed every year.</p>

            <p>Lab grown meat producers are developing a wide range of meat products. Thsi data scraped from Wikipedia shows where and what lab grown meat producers are making. Silicon Valley, Israel and the Netherlands are pioneering development. Singapore is leading in the adoption of lab grown meat.</p>

            <p>Many market analysts predic lab grown meat will never be widely adopted due to its high production costs. This graph shows the predicted costs of producing lab grown meat in the US. Cell culture mediums, bioreactors and labour make up the largest costs. This paper predicsts the minimum cost of lab grown meat to be 63$/KG.</p>

        <h3>Adaptation</h3>
        <hr>
        <h1>How will we transition to lab grown meat?</h1>
        <p>Lab grown meat will never be widely adopted if consumers are suspicious of them. A common barrier is known as the 'yuk' factor as consumers are sceptical of the meats hygeine.</p> 
        
    <!-- Chart 1 -->
    
        <div class="container">
            <p>This graph from a survey of 1,930 UK adults shows attitudes towards lab grown meats by age, and other alternative proteins. We observe consumer hesitance towards lab grown meats with 43% saying they are unqilling to try it. However, younger consumers are more open to them.</p>

    <!-- Conclusion -->

        <h3>Conclusion</h3>
        <hr>
        <p> These graphs have shown the past, present and future of the meat industry. For lab grown meats to become viable alternatives to traditional meat, producers will have to overcome the huge cost barrier, whilst consumers will need to overcome the 'yuk' factor. This transition needs to happen to avoid an increase in the environmental costs of meat production.</p>

<!-- My Data -->
    <div class="myWeek1">
        <hr>
        <h3>My data</h3>
        <hr>
        <p>I found my data from various sources. In most cases, I either extracted data from websites by scraping them using python which I then transformed to CSV or json format before exporting them to github. I used this approach for graphs 4 and 5.</p>
        <p>I also used a python scraper to collect data from tabled stored in a PDF, which I used to make graph 6.</p>
        <p>I used an ONS API to make graph 3. Starting with python to get updated json files which I could then upload to github.</p>
        <p>Graphs 1,2 and 7 use openly accessible datasets saved as CSV files which are updated infrequently.</p>
        <p>My biggest challenge was finding data for an API as many exisitng datasets are predictive or are not updated regularly. I also struggled with scraping the PDF to extract tables.</p>
